# WaveTable Synthesizer
Made by **Aidan Baird**

 **Wave Playback on Demand**: 
   - Generates audio when an XML request specifies notes for the "wavetable" instrument.

 **AR Envelope Generation**: 
   - Utilizes the AR class to modify sound sources for attack and release. 
   - Supports two Wavetable/Sample synthesis instruments: one with samples â‰¤ 4410 frames, the other with samples > 1 second.

 **Wavetable Synthesis**: 
   - Employs short audio recordings of sound waveforms from real instruments or generated mathematically. 
   - Provides five or more waveforms available for playback as directed by the sequencer.

Key features include:

- **Attack and Sustain Waves**: Initial sound followed by a recurring sound.
- **Pitch**: Allows playback at different rates.
- **Glissando**: Smooth transition between notes.

## Sample Score
Here is a sample score to demonstrate the wavetable effects attack, release, and glissando.
